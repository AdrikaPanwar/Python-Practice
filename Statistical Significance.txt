                                                           STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:-


-----    Hypothesis in Statistics
Hypothesis is an assumption about a parameter in population.

------    Null Hypothesis
It assumes that the observation is not statistically significant.

------    Alternate Hypothesis
It assumes that the observations are due to some reason.

It's alternate to Null Hypothesis.

Example:

For an assessment of a student we would take:

"student is worse than average" - as a null hypothesis, and:

"student is better than average" - as an alternate hypothesis.

--------   One tailed test
When our hypothesis is testing for one side of the value only, it is called "one tailed test".

Example:

For the null hypothesis:

"the mean is equal to k", we can have alternate hypothesis:

"the mean is less than k", or:

"the mean is greater than k"

-------    Two tailed test
When our hypothesis is testing for both side of the values.

Example:

For the null hypothesis:

"the mean is equal to k", we can have alternate hypothesis:

"the mean is not equal to k"

In this case the mean is less than, or greater than k, and both sides are to be checked.

-------   Alpha value
Alpha value is the level of significance.

Example:

How close to extremes the data must be for null hypothesis to be rejected.

It is usually taken as 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1.

--------   P value
P value tells how close to extreme the data actually is.

P value and alpha values are compared to establish the statistical significance.

If p value <= alpha we reject the null hypothesis and say that the data is statistically significant. otherwise we accept the null hypothesis.
