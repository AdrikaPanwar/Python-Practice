# This is just my practice when I was learning Python in my initial phase, but it is still useful for me

## I use it sometimes to revise my concept (I wrote code as notes and did exercises so it helps me to overcome my problem of taking notes by hand)

### So, I have also added other .txt files in this repo (so you can also understand the confusing concept)

### In the beginning most of the topics were new to me, so covering each topic line by line; I mostly use Copilot to clear my concepts 

### And wandering a lot on the internet is also very fun and complicated too, then I just create a file and directly copy-paste the main point

### Which will be helpful for me, so here is my .txt file (you can read it to without searching on the internet each topic line-by-line) and still I have used it a lot.

## I open it when needed, hope it will be helpful for you too

## Have a nice day :)
